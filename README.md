# This is a Where's Waldo Game with a Persistent Leaderboard

![Image](wheres-waldo/src/Resources/Screencap/wheresWaldo.png)

This Web App is my shot at building a "Where's Waldo" game with a persistent leaderboard as a submission for The Odin Project's Where's Waldo JavaScript Project.

The project was built using React, TailwindCSS, and Firebase.

## Functionality

- Users can play a game of "Where's Waldo" by clicking on the green "Play Now" button.

- This will begin a game where the user will need to find all three (3) Where's Waldo characters (Waldo, Odlaw, and the Wizard) in as short a time as possible.

- As the user finds each character, they will need to click on the character to tell the game that they have found the characters.

- Once clicked, the corresponding character portrait in the top-left corner of the screen will change the grayscale.

- Once all characters are found, the user will be shown their time and asked for a display name to submit their time to the leaderboard.

- All of the leaderboard data is stored using Firebase Firestore

If you want to have a look just press the github-pages button to the right of this README. While you're there feel free to play a round and submit your time to the leaderboard.
